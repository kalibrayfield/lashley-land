		<h2>Recreational</h2>
		Nebraska is a game hunter’s paradise offering an abundance of hunting and fishing opportunities year-round.

		In the fall and winter time, hunting season takes off. During the fall and winter months, Nebraska is a destination-hunting wonderland. Both Whitetail and Mule deer are prolific in the varied habitat in Nebraska, and they grow large by feeding on the numerous corn and alfalfa fields that dot the landscape. The Central Flyway narrows like an hour-glass right through Nebraska, so the waterfowl hunting here is some of the best in the world. True upland game hunters know that they will find tremendous dove, pheasant and quail populations. With 17 rivers, countless creeks, streams and natural springs, and dozens of lakes, Nebraska offers fantastic fishing! Not only does Nebraska provide exceptional hunting and fishing opportunities, there are also other countless recreational activities to do, such as kayaking, swimming, boating, tubing, golf, and more!
